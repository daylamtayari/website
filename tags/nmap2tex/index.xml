&lt;p&gt;What is Nmap2Tex? Well as it's name suggests, it converts a Nmap (a network scanner) scan result into a nicely pre-formatted LaTeX document containing all of the important information from the scan and also colour coding some components such as vulnerabilities according to their CVSS or hosts based on how vulnerable they are.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The inspiration of this project really stems from my experience competing in the national Collegiate Cyber Defense (CCDC) competition, a collegiate cybersecurity competition which aims to help give students experience in a blue team environment, providing each team with a whole network infrastructure with everything from a firewall, a variety of both Linux and Windows machines and occasionally also VoIP devices. &lt;br/&gt;
Throughout this competition, we must execute injects (task requests by the organisers) all while being constantly attacked by a professional red team and having to perform the respective incident response.&lt;br/&gt;
One particular inject that is present in every competition and which is requested in the beginning stages of the competition is a network inventory. In this report, we must include every device running on the network, their information (OS, hostname, IP) and the list of open ports and their respective services but also the list of vulnerabilities present on each machine on the system.&lt;br/&gt;
We usually rely on using Nmap to scan the network and retrieve all necessary information for the report.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now at one recent invitational, I was tasked with performing this inject and let me just say that manually typing up the results of a Nmap scan on around a dozen devices, each running a large number of services, is incredibly frustrating to say the least which is exacerbated by how time intensive it is.&lt;br/&gt;
It was while completing that inject that I made the decision that I would never again let myself complete this inject in such a painstaking way, let alone let someone else on my team also suffer through this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Since Nmap has an option to output into XML and due to my fondness for LaTeX, I decided that I would build a tool that would take in the Nmap scan result in an XML format and then convert it into a nicely formatted LaTeX document based on a provided template.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is the result of that, here releasing version 0.1 which contains full support for Nmap network scan and vulnerability scan conversions among other things.&lt;br/&gt;
Version 0.1 is the initial version of the program and it's version number will continue to increase until I release version 1.0 when I am satisfied with the project and it's state.&lt;br/&gt;

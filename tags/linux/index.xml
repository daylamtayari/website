&lt;p&gt;One frustration that every Linux user has experienced is when you need to run a particular program that is only available for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While for the overwhelming majority of applications there are equivalent solutions in Linux, sometimes the native Windows application is just what you need to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is because your professional workflow requires you to use it or the equivalent solutions are just not nearly as powerful as the original (looking at you Excel), there are times where your use case demands the Windows program.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Qubes OS - A Technical Introduction</title><link>https://tayari.gg/talks/qubes-technical-introduction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 00:52:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tayari.gg/talks/qubes-technical-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that I daily drive Qubes OS on both my laptop and desktop and have been for over a year was something that piqued the curiosity of multiple people in the ASU Linux User's Group which prompted the request for me to present a talk on Qubes OS and not only how it works but what truly differentiates it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to try to accommodate everyone regardless of technical knowledge, I started the presentation off with a general overview, mostly focusing on the user experience of Qubes before slowly diving deeper and deeper into its drivers and architecture and their respective technical details.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

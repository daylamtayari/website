&lt;p&gt;The fact that I daily drive Qubes OS on both my laptop and desktop and have been for over a year was something that piqued the curiosity of multiple people in the ASU Linux User's Group which prompted the request for me to present a talk on Qubes OS and not only how it works but what truly differentiates it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to try to accommodate everyone regardless of technical knowledge, I started the presentation off with a general overview, mostly focusing on the user experience of Qubes before slowly diving deeper and deeper into its drivers and architecture and their respective technical details.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

Across my penetration testing experience, I have worked with a multitude of industry-leading clients to best address their security concerns and performed network, application, and cloud penetration tests as well as secure code reviews.</p><p>I enjoy developing tools and programs across both my professional career and my free time. Go has been my language of choice for some time however, also well experienced with Python, Java, and to a lesser extent C++, Rust, and JavaScript.</p><p>I am also passionate about Linux, personally daily driving Qubes and Arch across both my personal and professional devices for the last 7 years. I've been actively involved in Linux User Groups, particularly ASU's ASULUG, where I presented multiple talks and organized major guest speakers. Cannot imagine living without a native UNIX shell.</p><p>Whenever I am able to, I attend local infosec meetups so if you ever want to chat, you can expect me to see me there.</p><p>Away from the keyboard, I am an avid runner and triathlete, competing primarily in longer distances such as Ironmans, marathons, as well as olympic distance triathlons.</p><p>This site contains a compilation of my projects, talks, guides, as well as articles I have written.</p><p><strong>You can find the latest iteration of my resume at: <a href=https://resume.tayari.gg>https://resume.tayari.gg</a></strong></p><p id=contact></p><h2 id=contact-me>Contact Me</h2><p>If you wish to contact me, please do so via email to <a href=mailto:daylam@tayari.gg>daylam@tayari.gg</a>.<br></p><p>For <strong>professional inquiries, please use <a href=mailto:daylamtayari@tayari.gg>daylamtayari@tayari.gg</a></strong>.</p><h2 id=support-me>Support Me</h2><p>While never expected, if you wish to support my work, you can do so in the following ways:</p><ul><li>PayPal <a href=https://paypal.me/daylamtayari target=_blank><a href=https://paypal.me/daylamtayari>https://paypal.me/daylamtayari</a></a></li><li>Kofi <a href=https://ko-fi.com/tayari target=_blank><a href=https://ko-fi.com/tayari>https://ko-fi.com/tayari</a></a></li><li>Bitcoin <code>15KcKrsqW6DQdyZPrgRXXmsKkyyZzHAQVX</code></li></ul><p id=disclaimer></p><h2 id=disclaimer>Disclaimer</h2><p>All views and opinions expressed on this site are personal and solely the opinions of the owner and do not represent those of any individual or entity the owner is associated or affiliated with any capacity, both personal and professional, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

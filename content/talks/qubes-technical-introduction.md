## Introduction

The fact that I daily drive Qubes OS on both my laptop and desktop and have been for over a year was something that piqued the curiosity of multiple people in the ASU Linux User's Group which prompted the request for me to present a talk on Qubes OS and not only how it works but what truly differentiates it.<br/>

In order to try to accommodate everyone regardless of technical knowledge, I started the presentation off with a general overview, mostly focusing on the user experience of Qubes before slowly diving deeper and deeper into its drivers and architecture and their respective technical details.

I presented this talk on the 5<sup>th</sup> of February 2022 at the weekly ASULUG meeting and while it was recorded, the recording quality is extremely poor so have refrained from posting it down below though the slides are included down below.

## Introduction

**Welcome!** I am Daylam Tayari, an experienced penetration testing consultant at [Bishop Fox](https://bishopfox.com) who also has development experience across both my professional career and my free time, working on a multitude of open-source tools. Across my penetration testing experience, I have worked with a multitude of industry-leading clients to best address their security concerns and performed network, application, and cloud penetration tests as well as secure code reviews.

I enjoy developing tools and programs across both my professional career and my free time. Go has been my language of choice for some time however, also well experienced with Python, Java, and to a lesser extent C++, Rust, and JavaScript.

I am also passionate about Linux, personally daily driving Qubes and Arch across both my personal and professional devices for the last 7 years. I've been actively involved in Linux User Groups, particularly ASU's ASULUG, where I presented multiple talks and organized major guest speakers. Cannot imagine living without a native UNIX shell.

Whenever I am able to, I attend local infosec meetups so if you ever want to chat, you can expect me to see me there.

Away from the keyboard, I am an avid runner and triathlete, competing primarily in longer distances such as Ironmans, marathons, as well as olympic distance triathlons.

This site contains a compilation of my projects, talks, guides, as well as articles I have written.
